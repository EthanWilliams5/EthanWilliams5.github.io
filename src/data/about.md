# Intro

I became a full stack developer because it is a way for me to utilize my problem solving skills and intense focus to achieve difficult outcomes. I am able to pick up new ideas/technologies and change strategies rapidly. I am a dedicated and hard working individual that values the small details.


# Currently

I am looking forward to an amazing career as a software engineer. After self-teaching computer science fundamentals in Javascript, and taking a couple CS classes at the local community college, I joined Hack Reactor, a 19-week software-engineering immersive program with over 1000+ hours of coding. Through this experience I honed my skills in JavaScript and Python, plus learned several new technologies including: React, Django, Docker, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.


# Some history

My previous work was in healthcare where I assisted in preforming emergency/elective surgeries on a daily basis. Before that I did the same thing in the U.S Air Force. That job and the experience of the military taught me the value of teamwork, how be effective in high stress situations, and resourcefulness.
